# Kremala

Is a game written in python and run in terminal 

Player VS Player  // Player VS Copmuter

To run the game just download the Kremala.py file and words.txt, find via terminal the location of the file "Kremala.py" 
and type the command "python3 Kremala.py". (Kremala.py and words.txt must be in the same location!)

Also it would be better if you had already change the dimension of your terminal as the Terminal_Dimensions 
file that i have upload says. Finally if you want to you can also put as background of your terminal one of the 
optional wall2/wall3 pictures that i have also uploaded to make the game more funny!

HAVE FUN ! :D
